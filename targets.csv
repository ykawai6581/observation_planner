Ingress is at 20:55 UT (airmass 1.03), transit mid-point at 23:05 (airmass 1.27) and egress at 01:10 (airmass 2.44). This means that we are able to collect between 8 and 17 radial velocities during the transit using exposure times between 30 and 15 min., 2-4 RVs before ingress and maybe 1-2 after the egress. During next two nights of this run we may observe this planet at orbital phases 0.33-0.41 and 0.7-0.8.

Khalid and the TRAPPIST-N team observed a egress -150/+110 min on 20200924 zp and ruled an a transit on target during the +/-0.3σ window. There were no obvious NEBs spotted off target. SAFFIs show a likely NEB near AIJ aperture T3 (TRAPPIST aperture #455), which is a dT=3.4 neighbor 17 SW (TIC). The SPOC centroid analysis is compromised by poor diff image quality, but the difference SNR image supports an offset of ~1 TESS pixel to the SW of the target (and if you look closely, the diff image also supports the interpretation of a brighter pixel to the SW - although the offset is skewed to the brighter star to the SE - which is cleared by SAFFIs). The TRAPPIST star #445 does not show a sign of NEB, but the coverage of the +/-20 hour 3σ ephemeris uncertainty is minimal. Gabrielle Ross, Andrew Vanderburg, and Zoe de Beurs analyzed ZTF images of TIC 200593988 (T24) and probably ruled out an 8 ppt event on-target and detected a 1.5σ early signal on TIC 200593982 (T20, Tmag = 15.8, rho = 17.6”, PA = 188.7°) using a revised period of 7.6939939.

However, the Gaia color and magnitude indicate that this is an early M dwarf, with a later-type companion. I confirmed a flat-bottomed transit with an aperture radius of 5”, which is fully contaminated by the companion. I also observed a deeper transit in z-band, which indicates that the transiting object is orbiting the companion star rather than the primary. The observed transit depth (~1.6 %) and flux ration of the two stars (~1.8 in G band) suggest that the transiting object could have a size consistent with a planet. I think this is an intriguing target for validation and true-radius measurement by multiband photometry, while mass measurements might be challenging for IRD and CARMENES. Additional multiband photometry with MuSCAT2/MuSCAT3 would be worthwhile to better constrain the true radius. Here is a report to TFOP: We observed a full transit of TOI04735.01 in g, r, zs bands with Okayama 188cm/MuSCAT on Jan. 27, 2022.

With the smallest aperture possible (1.74 arcsec, file ending in Aper1p74.pdf) the transit is not detected on target with significance (target star should have some low level of flux contamination from Star ID 23). With an aperture size of 4.35 arcsec (i.e., including flux from Star ID 23) an on-time transit event is detected, given the scater on the light curves I think we can't say of the transit is achromatic or not. However looking at the blend analysis using the second smallest aperture, there seems to be some variation in Star ID 4; fitting a transit to Star ID 4 with an aperture with little to no flux contamination from Star ID 23 (aperture size of 3.04 arcsec) we find an earlier than predicted chromatic transit event.

The main concern from my perspective is that the rp, ip, and zs depths are about 2x the TESS-band depth, while the gp depth is similar to the TESS-band depth. QLP s07 shows odd/even sigma=1.7, SPOC s34 shows an odd/even sigma=2.3, but then when the two sectors are combined in QLP s34, the odd/even sigma becomes 11.9 (in all 3 cases, the odd signals are deeper). The huge increase with just two sectors combined sounds a little bit suspicious to me, but the event is V-shaped and it's not an L1 candidate, so I'll let it go for now as an EB.

DaveL also notes: There is a big gap in the HIRES coverage that is centered on that lone TRES observation in the summer of 2021. The drift shown by the HIRES velocities is up, in the opposite direction of the TRES velocities. This leaves open the possibility that there is outer orbital motion that went down after the first cluster of TRES velocities, and are now on their way back up, passing through the final lone TRES velocities.

The eclipse itself only lasts around 5 minutes, so we'd only really need, say, 20 minutes total in order to get the eclipse and enough out of eclipse photometry to be useful.

There a possible >>5σ early 300 ppt event in T4 (TIC 952531020: T=18.37, dT=7.55, r=41.9 WSW), but it is near another star, so could be due to the large change in FWHM during roughly the same time. Also, SPOC centroids strongly suggest the event is on-target. The published 21.7 day period is twice that found by SPOC since the even signal is much stronger than the odd signal. However, the published T0 corresponds to the SPOC odd events, so we need to add 21.7/2 days to T0 to check the even phase. These data apparently rule out the original 10.9 day period.

The transit event is too shallow to be detected given the scatter in the light curve (the reference stars are much fainter than the target). We can ruled out star id 8 as an EB with a deep transit.

Greg Srdoc and Karen Collins analyzed a full on 20210516 from LCO-M3 in gp, rp, ip, zs and detected a chromatic 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 event in a 5.4"" target aperture that is contaminated with a speckle ΔI = 3.3 neighbor 0.83"" SE. Eric Jensen conducted a joint MCMC analysis and finds that the amount of extra flux needed increases strongly toward the blue, with as much as 10x or more contaminating flux is needed in gp as in zs. Looking back at the two previously reported MuSACT2 achromatic transits, I think they are both consistent with the MuSCAT3 chromatic results and show a deeper event in red than in blue. Eric's analysis suggests the 0.8"" companion hosts the transits since the nominal TOI is a relatively hot star, which would likely dilute the transit more in the blue if the event is on the ΔI = 3.3 fainter neighbor (assuming it is a cooler star). Assuming T_mag ~ I_mag, the depth in the neighbor would be ~35 ppt. Without a more full characterization of the neighbor, it's not clear if it is an EB or possibly hosts a transiting planet. As Eric also mentions, maybe the nominal TOI star could still host the eclipse if the primary is itself an unresolved binary. If that’s the case, we might again have the issue of whether the eclipse would have to be too deep (after accounting for dilution) to be planetary. Retired as APC/BEB.""",1610,,,APC,2,,,,,

No more observations needed, except for extreme precision (<0.5 ppt/5 min) full transits to again detect the shallow event on target in a red (r', R, i', I, z, Y) filter.

I changed the period value to the current TFOP value to avoid this (P_old = 0.4305826 days --> P_new = 0.4304996 days). Let's try a third transit for M&Ms Observed on 02/05. Report: The observations were affected by clouds. We detect a V-shaped and chromatic transit event on target. We had some previous MuSCAT2 obs. for this target, for that data set we only caught the egress and saw no chromaticity (probably because the transit was incomplete).

The field was cleared. This one is a mystery to me so far. The TESS detection is fairly recent (s54), and the ephemeris uncertainty is small (10 min). The event is clear by eye in the undetrended QLP lightcurve. There is a possible Gaia EB with half the period (0.35 d) 32 NE, but it is nominally a 2.3 magnitudes too faint in TESS-band to be capable of causing the QLP detection. There are no QLP centroid results, but the depth does not appear to be correlated with QLP aperture size, and SAFFIs are consistent with on-target, but do not rule out an event at 30"". There is no velocity offset between the two TRES observations near quadratures for the 0.7-day period. I think we would have seen the signal for an Rp=7 planet, and certainly for a brown dwarf.

They obtained two complete follow-up transit observations using the LCOGT 1m network on 2017-06-28 and 2017-07-20 and 1 Coralie observation, 9 FEROS observations, 11 HARPS observations, and 3 PFS observations between 23 April 2017 and 02 August 2018. The HARPS and PFS RVs together phase up with the photometric ephemeris, yielding an orbital variation with a semi-amplitude of K = 22.82 +- 0.86 m/s, and indicating a ~0.19 M_J sub-Saturn mass for the planet. High-precision spectroscopic parameters have been determined based on a ZASPE analysis of the FEROS spectra. Pablo Lewin observed a full on 20190822 in V and tentatively detected a ~30 minute early 14 ppt event on target among some apparent systematics using a 5"" uncontaminated aperture.

The telescope had to be closed due to strong winds after ingress causing a gap in the observations. There were issues with the photometry in g-band so we couldn't use this filter for the transit. We detect the transit event on target although with little to none baseline and in addition with the gap this detection could be spurious. I think the transit is real but it could also be that the pipeline is forcing the transit fit; there is little baseline. There are no TFOP observations for this TOI, so maybe is worth uploading this data set. WE can try a second observation just in case. Observations on 11/10. Report: The observations were affected by vignetting by the dome hatch. The transit was observed without vignetting but the out-of-transit data was affected. The transit is visible in the blend analysis plot but the transit fit doesn't converge if I use the full time series, the systematics caused by the hatch vignetting are too strong to be modeled with the current parametrisation. The vignetting was caused by the hatch and not dome rotation because they occured at the same elevations (I've attached the elevation plot and a screenshot of the full light curve plot), the vignetting stops at around ~20:09 UT (elevation 50º, 2459864.34 BJD) and it stars again at ~01:55 UT (elevation 50º, 2459864.58 BJD). This is weird because the hatch is supposed to produce vignetting at 40º when is not working (I have that number from memory, I could be wrong). I don't think the data will be useful, we have 1 good observation from this target in TFOP but maybe we can try one more time. Observed on 20/10.
